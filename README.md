# The effects of mutation and recombination rate heterogeneity on the inference of demography and the distribution of fitness effects

Vivak Soni, Susanne P. Pfeifer, and Jeffrey D. Jensen.

Repository contains scripts to run generate input files and run demographic and DFE inference on SLiM output, as per Soni et al. 2023 (https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/16/2/evae004/7517031).

Scripts folder contains SLiM simulation scripts, as well as python scripts to generate input files for downstream inference. Jupyter scripts to reproduce plots are contained in scripts/plotting folder.

Mutation and recombination rate maps are contained in zip folders. Script to generate maps is included in scripts/variable rates.

Outputs from demographic and DFE inference are contained in .tar.gz files.
